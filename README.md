# DatStruPro

## Overview
Welcome to DatStruPro! This repository contains two projects focusing on different data structures and algorithms implemented in C programming language.

## Projects

### Project1
**Description**: Project1 demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. It reads integers from an input file (`input.txt`), sorts them using Bubble Sort, and writes the sorted integers to an output file (`output.txt`).

**Files**:
- `pro1.c`: Contains the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm and file I/O operations.
- `input.txt`: Contains unsorted integers.
- `output.txt`: Stores the sorted integers after sorting.

### Project2
**Description**: Project2 showcases the insertion of a new word into a sorted dictionary array. It prompts the user to enter a new word, inserts it into the dictionary array maintaining alphabetical order, and displays the updated dictionary.

**Files**:
- `pro2.c`: Implements the insertion of a new word into a sorted dictionary array and user interaction.
- No additional files are required for this project.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the respective project folder (`Project1` or `Project2`).
3. Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
   ```bash
   gcc pro1.c -o pro1 # For Project1
   ```
   ```bash
   gcc pro2.c -o pro2 # For Project2
   ```
4. Run the compiled executable.
   ```bash
   ./pro1 # For Project1
   ```
   ```bash
   ./pro2 # For Project2
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions for Project2 to insert a new word into the dictionary.

## Note
- Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system to compile the programs.
- For Project1, make sure `input.txt` exists and contains valid integer inputs.
